### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project helped me the basics of:

- Styling cards with consistent spacing and hover animations
- Applying semantic tags and maintaining accessibility as much as i can.
- Practiced modular CSS, keeping styles organized with reusable classes and a clear naming convention.
- Writing clean, reusable CSS with custom properties and resets

#### Example snippet:

```css
  .card:hover {
  transform: scale(1.02);
  }

  .avatar {
  width: 2.5rem;
  height: 2.5rem;
  border-radius: 50%;
}

  ```
  
            **Continued development**
1. Enhancing hover/focus accessibility features
2. Adding dark mode toggle functionality
3. Using CSS Grid for layout control 

           **Useful resources**
1. Figma
2. WebAIM – Accessible Design Principles
3. MDN Web Docs - Flexbox – Helped clarify centering elements with Flexbox.
